# MasterMind
C# console application - MasterMind game
My solution includes universal GameEngine class and dedicated for polish players GameInterface.

Master Mind is a code-breaking game for 2 players (in this case it's Computer vs User). 
Computer generates code based on user's preferances like code length and colors.
The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within 9 turns (number of turns can be changed).
